# EventyVR
small project for me...
I think about nice page with a lot of features on one page like: 
- floating elements using jQuery,
- RWD,
- jQuery Mobile - The Roller Theme,
- Dashboard Admin to customize $(this) page,
- add plugins - widgets on demand.
- Bootstrap
- Login/Register
- Users: Basic/Premium/Pro
        A) Basic - list of offerts, descriptions, samples
        B) Premium - list of offerts, possible discounts, full version
        C) Pro  - list of offerts, possible discounts, full version extended, creating own events
        
- shop (fake)

I will provide some pictures of my vision...soon
